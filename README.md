## Overview

This is my **first practice sign-up page** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It features a modern, responsive design with styled input fields, hover effects, interactive buttons, and a split layout with an image panel — making it a simple yet effective web development exercise.

- **Styled Input Fields** with placeholder text, hover animations, and italic text styling  
- **Interactive Buttons** for "Sign Up" with smooth scaling animations  
- **Background Image** for enhanced visual appeal  
- **Image Panel with Hover Flip Effect** for dynamic interaction  
- **JavaScript Alerts** to simulate sign-up and sign-in actions
